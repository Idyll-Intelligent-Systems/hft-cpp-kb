# JPMorgan HFT Probability Problem: Risk Management and Market Microstructure
==================================================================================

## Problem Statement

You are working as a quantitative analyst at JPMorgan's HFT desk. Your team needs to analyze and model various risk scenarios and market microstructure phenomena. This document covers key probability and statistical concepts essential for HFT operations.

## 1. Market Making and Adverse Selection

### Scenario
Your market making algorithm quotes bid/ask spreads for a stock. Historical data shows:
- 60% of incoming orders are uninformed (random)
- 40% are informed trades (adverse selection)
- Uninformed trades are equally likely to be buy/sell
- Informed trades: 80% probability in the direction of true price movement

### Questions
1. If you see 3 consecutive buy orders, what's the probability the next order is also a buy?
2. What's the expected profit per trade if you charge a 2 basis point spread?
3. How should you adjust spreads based on order flow toxicity?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Sequential Order Analysis

Let's define:
- U = Uninformed trade
- I = Informed trade  
- B = Buy order
- S = Sell order

Given:
- P(U) = 0.6, P(I) = 0.4
- P(B|U) = P(S|U) = 0.5
- P(B|I, price going up) = 0.8
- P(S|I, price going down) = 0.8

After observing 3 consecutive buys, we use Bayes' theorem to update probabilities.

**Initial probabilities:**
- P(B|U) = 0.5
- P(B|I) = Assume 0.65 (informed traders have slight directional bias)

**Likelihood of 3 consecutive buys:**
- P(BBB|U) = 0.5³ = 0.125
- P(BBB|I) = 0.65³ = 0.274

**Updated probabilities using Bayes:**
P(I|BBB) = [P(BBB|I) × P(I)] / [P(BBB|I) × P(I) + P(BBB|U) × P(U)]
P(I|BBB) = [0.274 × 0.4] / [0.274 × 0.4 + 0.125 × 0.6] = 0.594

**Probability of next buy:**
P(B₄|BBB) = P(B|I) × P(I|BBB) + P(B|U) × P(U|BBB)
P(B₄|BBB) = 0.65 × 0.594 + 0.5 × 0.406 = 0.589

#### Part 2: Expected Profit Analysis

**Spread Analysis:**
- Bid-ask spread = 2 basis points = 0.0002
- Half-spread = 1 basis point = 0.0001

**Expected profit per trade:**
- Against uninformed: +1 bp (capture half-spread)
- Against informed: -1 bp (adverse selection cost exceeds spread)

E[Profit] = P(U) × (+1 bp) + P(I) × (-1 bp)
E[Profit] = 0.6 × 0.0001 + 0.4 × (-0.0001) = 0.00002 = 0.2 bp

## 2. Value at Risk (VaR) and Extreme Events

### Scenario
Your HFT portfolio has the following characteristics:
- Daily P&L follows a normal distribution: N(μ = $1000, σ = $5000)
- However, 5% of days experience "regime shifts" with P&L ~ N(-$2000, $8000)

### Questions
1. Calculate the 99% VaR using normal distribution
2. Calculate the 99% VaR accounting for regime shifts
3. What's the expected shortfall (ES) at 99% level?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Normal VaR
Under normal distribution N(1000, 5000):
VaR₉₉% = μ - 2.33 × σ = 1000 - 2.33 × 5000 = -$10,650

#### Part 2: Mixture Model VaR
Mixed distribution:
- 95% of days: N(1000, 5000)
- 5% of days: N(-2000, 8000)

For 99% VaR, we need the 1st percentile of the mixture distribution.

Let F₁(x) and F₂(x) be CDFs of the two normal distributions.
Mixed CDF: F(x) = 0.95 × F₁(x) + 0.05 × F₂(x)

Using numerical methods or simulation:
VaR₉₉% ≈ -$16,800 (significantly higher than normal case)

#### Part 3: Expected Shortfall
ES₉₉% = E[Loss | Loss > VaR₉₉%]

This requires integration over the tail distribution:
ES₉₉% ≈ -$21,500

## 3. Options Market Making and Greeks Risk

### Scenario
You're market making options and need to manage Greeks exposure:
- Portfolio Delta: +150
- Portfolio Gamma: -80
- Portfolio Vega: +200
- Current stock price: $100
- Daily stock volatility: 2%

### Questions
1. What's the probability of losing more than $10,000 tomorrow?
2. How many shares should you hedge to be Delta-neutral?
3. What's the VaR contribution from Gamma risk?

### Solution

#### Delta-Gamma Approximation
Portfolio P&L ≈ Delta × ΔS + 0.5 × Gamma × (ΔS)²

Where ΔS ~ N(0, 2% × $100) = N(0, $2)

#### Part 1: Probability of Large Loss
P&L = 150 × ΔS - 40 × (ΔS)²

For loss > $10,000:
150 × ΔS - 40 × (ΔS)² < -10,000

This is a quadratic inequality. Solving:
ΔS < -$3.75 or ΔS > $7.5

P(|ΔS| > 3.75) ≈ 0.03% (given ΔS ~ N(0, 2))

#### Part 2: Delta Hedging
To be Delta-neutral, sell 150 shares of the underlying stock.

#### Part 3: Gamma VaR
Gamma contribution to VaR (99% level):
VaR_Gamma = 0.5 × |Gamma| × (2.33 × σ_S)²
VaR_Gamma = 0.5 × 80 × (2.33 × 2)² = $866

## 4. High-Frequency Trading and Latency Models

### Scenario
Your HFT system has the following latency characteristics:
- Order processing time ~ Exponential(λ = 1000/sec)
- Network latency ~ Normal(μ = 0.5ms, σ = 0.1ms)
- Market data processing ~ Gamma(shape = 2, rate = 5000/sec)

### Questions
1. What's the probability of processing an order in under 2ms?
2. What's the 95th percentile of total latency?
3. How does latency affect your edge against slower competitors?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Order Processing Probability
Processing time ~ Exp(1000)
P(T < 0.002) = 1 - e^(-1000 × 0.002) = 1 - e^(-2) ≈ 0.865

#### Part 2: Total Latency Distribution
Total latency = Processing + Network + Market Data Processing

Using convolution or simulation:
95th percentile ≈ 3.2ms

#### Part 3: Competitive Edge Model
If competitors have latency L_c and you have L_y:
- Win probability ∝ P(L_y < L_c)
- Expected edge = f(latency advantage) × market opportunity

## 5. Pairs Trading and Cointegration

### Scenario
You're trading two cointegrated stocks with the following relationship:
- log(P₁) - β × log(P₂) = μ + εₜ
- εₜ follows an AR(1) process: εₜ = φ × εₜ₋₁ + ηₜ
- ηₜ ~ N(0, σ²), φ = 0.95, σ = 0.01

### Questions
1. Current spread = 2.5 standard deviations. What's the probability of mean reversion within 5 days?
2. What's the optimal position size using Kelly criterion?
3. How do you handle regime changes in the cointegration relationship?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Mean Reversion Probability
Starting at ε₀ = 2.5σ, the spread follows:
εₜ = φᵗ × ε₀ + noise

After 5 days: ε₅ ~ N(0.95⁵ × 2.5σ, σ²_conditional)

P(mean reversion) = P(|ε₅| < σ) ≈ 0.68

#### Part 2: Kelly Criterion
For optimal position sizing:
f* = (bp - q) / b

Where:
- b = odds received
- p = probability of success
- q = probability of failure

Kelly fraction = Expected return / Variance of returns

#### Part 3: Regime Detection
Use techniques like:
- Kalman filtering for time-varying β
- Hidden Markov models for regime switches
- Structural break tests (Chow test, CUSUM)

## 6. Risk Attribution and Factor Models

### Scenario
Your portfolio has exposures to multiple risk factors:
- Market factor: β₁ = 1.2, daily vol = 1.5%
- Size factor: β₂ = -0.3, daily vol = 0.8%
- Value factor: β₃ = 0.6, daily vol = 1.0%
- Idiosyncratic risk: σᵢ = 0.5%

Factor correlation matrix:
```
     Market  Size   Value
Market  1.0   0.3   -0.2
Size    0.3   1.0    0.1
Value  -0.2   0.1    1.0
```

### Questions
1. What's the total portfolio volatility?
2. What's the contribution of each factor to portfolio risk?
3. How do you optimize the risk-return trade-off?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Portfolio Volatility
σₚ² = β'Σβ + σᵢ²

Where β = [1.2, -0.3, 0.6] and Σ is the factor covariance matrix.

Factor covariance matrix:
```
Σ = [0.015²    0.015×0.008×0.3   -0.015×0.010×0.2]
    [0.015×0.008×0.3    0.008²    0.008×0.010×0.1]
    [-0.015×0.010×0.2   0.008×0.010×0.1    0.010²]
```

Total volatility: σₚ ≈ 1.89% daily

#### Part 2: Risk Attribution
Component contributions:
- Market risk: 72%
- Size risk: 8%
- Value risk: 15%
- Idiosyncratic risk: 5%

## 7. Algorithmic Trading and Market Impact

### Scenario
You need to execute a large order (1% of average daily volume) optimally:
- Permanent impact: I_p = γ × (Q/V)^α, where γ = 0.5, α = 0.6
- Temporary impact: I_t = η × (q/V)^β, where η = 0.3, β = 0.8
- Price drift: μ × t
- Volatility: σ × √t

### Questions
1. What's the optimal execution strategy (TWAP vs VWAP vs optimal)?
2. How do you balance market impact vs timing risk?
3. What's the implementation shortfall for different strategies?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Optimal Execution (Almgren-Chriss Model)
The optimal trading rate follows:
q(t) = Q × sinh(κ(T-t)) / sinh(κT)

Where κ = √(λγ/ησ²) balances market impact vs volatility risk.

#### Part 2: Implementation Shortfall
IS = (Arrival Price - Average Execution Price) × Shares
   = Market Impact + Timing Risk + Fees

Typical breakdown:
- TWAP: Higher timing risk, lower impact
- VWAP: Balanced approach
- Optimal: Minimizes total cost

## 8. Credit Risk and Default Correlation

### Scenario
You have exposure to a portfolio of corporate bonds with:
- Individual default probabilities: 2% annually
- Default correlation: ρ = 0.15
- Recovery rate: 40%
- Portfolio size: 100 bonds

### Questions
1. What's the probability of 0, 1, 2, ... defaults in one year?
2. What's the 99.9% VaR for credit losses?
3. How does correlation affect the loss distribution?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Default Distribution
Using the Gaussian copula model:
- Transform to standard normal: Φ⁻¹(0.02) = -2.05
- Joint distribution with correlation ρ = 0.15

Default probabilities follow a Beta-Binomial distribution.

#### Part 2: Credit VaR
Monte Carlo simulation:
1. Generate correlated standard normals
2. Transform to default indicators
3. Calculate portfolio losses
4. Find 99.9th percentile

Typical result: VaR₉₉.₉% ≈ 15-20% of portfolio value

#### Part 3: Correlation Impact
- ρ = 0: Binomial distribution, VaR ≈ 8%
- ρ = 0.15: Increased tail risk, VaR ≈ 18%
- ρ = 0.50: Heavy tails, VaR ≈ 35%

## 9. Volatility Modeling and GARCH

### Scenario
You're modeling the volatility of returns using GARCH(1,1):
σₜ² = ω + α × εₜ₋₁² + β × σₜ₋₁²

Estimated parameters:
- ω = 0.000001
- α = 0.08
- β = 0.90
- Current volatility: σₜ₋₁ = 2%

### Questions
1. What's the forecasted volatility for the next 5 days?
2. What's the long-run volatility?
3. How do you use this for option pricing and risk management?

### Solution

#### Part 1: Volatility Forecasting
σₜ² = 0.000001 + 0.08 × εₜ₋₁² + 0.90 × (0.02)²

Multi-period forecast:
σₜ₊ₕ² = σ²∞ + (α + β)ʰ × (σₜ² - σ²∞)

#### Part 2: Long-run Volatility
σ²∞ = ω / (1 - α - β) = 0.000001 / (1 - 0.98) = 0.00005
σ∞ = √0.00005 ≈ 2.24%

#### Part 3: Applications
- Option pricing: Use forecasted volatility in Black-Scholes
- VaR calculation: Dynamic volatility estimates
- Position sizing: Scale positions inversely with volatility

## 10. Statistical Arbitrage and Mean Reversion

### Scenario
You've identified a statistical arbitrage opportunity:
- Price ratio follows: dXₜ = κ(θ - Xₜ)dt + σdWₜ
- Current ratio: X₀ = 1.05
- Mean: θ = 1.00
- Mean reversion speed: κ = 0.5/day
- Volatility: σ = 0.02/day

### Questions
1. What's the probability the ratio reaches 0.98 before 1.08?
2. What's the expected time to mean reversion?
3. How do you size the position optimally?

### Solution

#### Part 1: First Passage Probability
For Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the probability of reaching barrier a before b:

P(hit a before b) = [e^(2κb/σ²) - e^(2κX₀/σ²)] / [e^(2κb/σ²) - e^(2κa/σ²)]

With our parameters:
P(hit 0.98 before 1.08) ≈ 0.73

#### Part 2: Expected Return Time
E[τ] = (1/κ) × ln[(X₀ - θ)/(Xₜ - θ)]

For return to θ = 1.00:
E[τ] ≈ 2.2 days

#### Part 3: Optimal Position Sizing
Use Kelly criterion with:
- Win probability: 0.73
- Expected return: 5%
- Risk (standard deviation): 8%

Kelly fraction ≈ 31% of capital
