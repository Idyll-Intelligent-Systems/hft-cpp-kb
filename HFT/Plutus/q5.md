# Connecting the Special Nodes

**Problem Statement**

You are given a graph of `N` nodes and `M` existing edges. The graph may consist of multiple connected components. Some components contain a *special* node and each component contains at most one special node. Your goal is to add new edges so that:

- No self-loops or multiple edges are created.
- No connected component ends up with more than one special node.
- Every node belongs to a component that contains exactly one special node.

Adding an edge between nodes in the **same** component costs `0`. Connecting nodes in **different** components costs the product of the sizes of the two components. Determine the maximum number of new edges that can be added while satisfying the above rules, and the minimum cost required.

## Input Format

1. The first line contains three integers `N M K` &ndash; number of nodes, number of existing edges, and the number of special nodes.
2. The next `M` lines each contain two integers `u v` describing an existing undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
3. The final line contains `K` space&ndash;separated integers indicating the special nodes.

## Output Format

Print two integers: the maximum count of new edges that can be added and the minimum total cost.

## Constraints

- `1 < N ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ M ≤ 2× 10^5`
- `1 ≤ K ≤ N`

## Example

```
Input
5 2 2
1 2
4 5
1 4

Output
1 4
```

In the example, connecting node `2` to node `3` joins two components of sizes `2` and `2`, costing `4` and producing a single component with one special node.
