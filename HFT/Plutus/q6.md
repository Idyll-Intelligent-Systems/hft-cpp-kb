# XOR Queries on Tree

**Problem Statement**

Alex has a weighted tree of `N` nodes. The tree is initially unweighted (`0` on every edge). A total of `M` queries will be performed. Each query provides two nodes `U_i` and `V_i`; for that query you XOR the weight of every edge along the path from `U_i` to `V_i` with Alex's favourite number.

Alex will be happy only if, after executing all queries, every edge in the tree still has weight `0`.

Determine whether there exists **any** tree and assignment of edges such that performing the queries leaves all weights `0`.

## Input Format

1. The first line has two integers `N M` &ndash; number of nodes and number of queries.
2. The next `N-1` lines each contain two integers describing the edges of the tree.
3. The following `M` lines each contain two integers `U_i V_i` for the queries.

## Output Format

Print `YES` if there exists a tree that satisfies Alex after all queries, otherwise print `NO`.

## Constraints

- `2 \le N \le 10^5`
- `1 \le M \le 10^5`

## Example

```
Input
3 2
1 2
2 3
1 2
2 3

Output
YES
```

Here the queries XOR the path `[1-2]` then `[2-3]`. Performing them on the given tree leaves all edge weights zero.
