g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra filename.cpp -o output

# For HFT code (maximum optimization)
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -march=native -DNDEBUG filename.cpp -o output

# With debugging symbols
g++ -std=c++17 -g -fsanitize=address filename.cpp -o output
```

### Running Examples
```bash
# Run any example
./output

# For performance testing
time ./output

# Memory profiling (if compiled with debug flags)
valgrind --tool=memcheck ./output
```
